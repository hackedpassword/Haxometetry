Dev tools and advanced modding and mapping in Unciv.

Considering making this an open repo for the Unciv community to contribute methods of modding by example that are tricky, unsupported, perhaps convoluted, or otherwise demonstrating something unusual. Out-of-the-box solutions that enhance the game experience, for modders or players. 

Proposed idea is to sectionalize the modhax item, note the components, document and describe what's happening.
